# Customer churn analysis of a telco dataset 📞

The aim of this notebook is to perform exploratory data analysis and develop machine learning models to a telecom customer churning dataset, which was sourced from [1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data). The notebook covers the following: (1) data cleaning, (2) exploratory data analysis, and (3) ML modeling.


Note that other machine learning models and additional EDA methods are planned to be included in the notebook. If you have feedback or any question in mind, please reach me at jprmaulion[at]gmail[dot]com. 🫶🏾
